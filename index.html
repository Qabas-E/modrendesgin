  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p>"The world's most powerful software for math and physics visualization
  . Create beautiful, interactive, dynamic, photorealistic 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D,
  6D, 7D and 8D graphs. So easy to use that even junior high and senior
  high students have had their graphs published. Includes hundreds of 
  examples contributed by users from around the world."
<br>
<br>
"Over two million mathematicians, physicists, teachers and students at 
over 1,000 colleges, universities and K-12 schools worldwide are already
licensed."
<br>
<br>
"Optimized for the internet -- search for DPGraph using your favorite 
search engine to find ways that people are using DPGraph for both 
classroom and distance learning. Used for pre-algebra, geometry, 
trigonometry and general physics, through multivariable calculus, 
field theory, quantum mechanics and gravitation."
<br>
<br>
"Use time and color as extra dimensions (to create motion or encode 
momentum, for example). Use the scrollbar to vary parameters in realtime,
to slice through graphs, or to vary transparency. Programmed entirely in
assembly language for maximum speed."
<br>
<br> 
"Graph functions, equations, conic sections, planes, spheres, toruses, 
parametric curves and surfaces, implicit equalities and inequalities, 
volume intersections, volumes of integration, vector fields, surfaces of 
revolution, equipotential surfaces, and much more, in rectangular, polar,
 cylindrical, or spherical coordinates."
